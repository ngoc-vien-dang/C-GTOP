# Mitigating Overdiagnosis Bias in CNN-Based Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis for the Elderly
Author: Vien Ngoc Dang

This repository contains the implementation of the paper **Mitigating Overdiagnosis Bias in CNN-Based Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis for the Elderly**. This project focuses on addressing overdiagnosis bias in 3D CNN-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis for elderly populations by proposing a novel post-hoc bias mitigation technique called Calibration and Group-specific Threshold Optimization (C-GTOP).

#### Supported Bias Mitigation Strategy
* Calibration and Group-specific Threshold Optimization (C-GTOP) (our proposed method)

#### How to Run the Code
* The `C-GTOP_Run.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the steps to run the C-GTOP algorithm for mitigating overdiagnosis bias in AD diagnosis.
* The `C_GTOP` directory contains the necessary Python scripts to implement the C-GTOP algorithm.

#### Data Availability
